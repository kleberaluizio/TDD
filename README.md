# TDD and Unit Tests

This project was developed with the goal of understanding and applying Test Driven Design (TDD) and Unit Tests.

> During the development of this code, Test Driven Design (TDD) provided me with the following mindset: Prioritize defining the desired code behavior before focusing on the implementation details.
> I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of tests and became proficient in determining when tests are necessary.
